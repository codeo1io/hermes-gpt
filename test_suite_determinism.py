"""Suite-determinism guards (rm-101).

Two invariants this repo has silently relied on:

1. Environment-dependent ``skipif`` markers are the ONLY reason a test result
   may differ between machines. They are few and deliberate; this guard makes
   the inventory explicit so a new skip cannot appear silently. If you add a
   skipif, register it here (and make sure its ``reason`` says what outside
   condition it depends on).

2. ``operator_policy``'s audit-log override is a process global. The
   autouse ``_reset_audit_log_override`` fixture in the root ``conftest.py``
   must guarantee it never leaks from one test into the next — proven here by
   a two-test sequence: the first leaks on purpose, the second asserts the
   pre-test state is clean.

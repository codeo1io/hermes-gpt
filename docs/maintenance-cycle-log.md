## Cycle 1 — 2026-09-21 — "Restore verifiable truth + safety-evidence integrity"

Run `a51b0f6cb5b04ea9855a3dc3aba88c78` against worktree at `54f826c0cd`
(`origin/master` `f8ba2e7862` is a docs-only merge ahead). Cycle phases: assess →
research → roadmap → prioritize → stewardship → implement → targeted tests → compound.
All outcomes below are pre-review: the batch was implemented and locally verified but
not yet reviewed, merged, or CI-verified.

### What the cycle did

- **rm-003 (P120)** — bound the five stale OAuth tests in
  `test_codex_pr63_remediation.py` to a real S256 challenge/verifier pair
  (`oauth_auth._s256`) so each exercises its stated contract instead of dying at the
  PKCE gate, and added `test_exchange_rejects_code_without_stored_challenge` to pin the
  fail-closed contract positively. Runtime `oauth_auth.py` was not weakened.
- **rm-007** — `test_mcp_compat.py:81` now skips with a reason when the distribution
  is not installed instead of erroring.
- **rm-009** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gained explicit `mcp==2.2.0` and
  `mcp==1.30.0` lanes, and `test_mcp_sdk_migration.py` gained
  `test_sdk_protocol_revision_is_deliberate` (fails loudly if the installed SDK
  advertises a protocol revision other than the one the tests pin).
- **rm-004** — `operator_policy.py` audit log: dynamic per-call path resolution
  (`HERMES_HOME/logs` → Windows `AppData\Local\hermes` → POSIX `~/.hermes` → package
  dir last resort), counted-and-surfaced write failures
  (`audit_write_diagnostics()` + doctor `WARN AUDIT_WRITE_FAILURES`), 5 MiB
  single-generation rotation, 512 KiB byte-bounded tail, task reconciliation that
  spans the rotation archive. Documented in `operator-mode.md` → Audit behavior.

Verification at end of implement: full suite **1438 passed / 6 skipped / 0 failed**
(system Python 3.11) and **1442 passed / 2 skipped** (fresh uv env, CPython 3.13,
distribution installed — the metadata test runs instead of skipping there).

### Prevention rules established

1. **Hardening changes ship their own positive fail-closed test.** PR #64's tests
   predated the PKCE-mandatory hardening in content but merged after it; nothing
   failed inside the PR's own context because the contradiction only appears against
   current master. From now on: an enforcement change (e.g. mandatory PKCE) must land
   in the same change as a test asserting the rejected-by-default case, so later
   tests cannot silently assume lenient behavior. Symptom to watch for: a test that
   "expects exchange success" while minting placeholder credentials.
2. **Resolve state paths per call, never as import-time platform constants.** The old
   `AUDIT_LOG_HERMES_PATH` baked Windows' layout into a module constant, so POSIX
   hosts silently fell back to the package directory and ignored `HERMES_HOME`.
   Pattern: `_audit_candidate_paths()` — environment first, then platform homes,
   package dir last, evaluated at call time so tests/embedded deployments take effect
   immediately.
3. **Best-effort must not mean invisible.** Swallowing `OSError` on audit writes was
   correct (a tool call must never break on audit persistence) but silent loss of
   evidence is a defect. Pattern: count failures in a module-level diagnostics dict,
   expose an accessor (`audit_write_diagnostics()`), and surface it in
   `hermes_operator_doctor` as `WARN`.
4. **Append-only files need bounded readers and a rotation story.** Full-file parses
   of an append-only JSONL grow without bound on long-lived hosts. Pattern: size-capped
   rotation keeping exactly one `.1` archive, byte-bounded reverse-read tails (drop the
   potentially partial first line), and task reconciliation that iterates archive +
   active so one rotation does not lose per-task evidence.
5. **Environment-absent is a skip, not a failure.** Tests that depend on the
   distribution being installed (metadata checks) must `pytest.skip(...)` on
   `PackageNotFoundError`; a red test in a bare checkout is CI-forensics noise that
   masks real regressions.
6. **Pin lanes age; assert the contract, not the pin.** Exact CI pins drift while
   `pyproject` ranges admit untested versions. Pattern: explicit lanes for every
   shipped SDK version plus a protocol-revision assertion that fails with guidance
   when the installed SDK advertises a different revision.

### Local toolchain notes (small, reusable)

- `pyproject.toml` sets `addopts = "-q"`, so `pytest -q` at the CLI is `-qq` and hides
  the summary line — run bare `python -m pytest` for canonical output; the exit code
  is still trustworthy.
- A uv-based full run needs `uv run --extra dev --with pytest-xdist python -m pytest
  -n 8` (pytest lives in the `dev` extra; pytest-xdist is not a project dependency).
  Candidate: add `pytest-xdist` to the `dev` extra so the canonical command runs
  unmodified.
- Two-environment verification (bare system Python vs uv env with the distribution
  installed) caught a skip-vs-run divergence in `test_mcp_compat.py` and is cheap:
  it exercises both the non-installed and installed code paths of metadata tests.

### Context left for the next cycle

- **rm-008 (branch protection on master)** is sequenced immediately after the first
  green master CI run following this batch's merge; master is currently unprotected
  (`gh api .../branches/master/protection` → 404).
- **rm-010 (CI-load-only failures)** needs a history of green runs to differ against;
  its two symptoms are token-rotation-vs-issuance fencing and a delegation-reconcile
  `IndexError` (test line ~1208).
- **Next reliability batch candidates:** rm-005 (session-jobs retention + `_watch`
  hardening — the `_processes`/`_active_sessions` leak was still observable as
  teardown noise during this cycle's full-suite runs) and rm-006 (integer/Decimal
  budget money; the ledger still uses REAL/floats with exact `>=` quota crossing).
- **rm-004 residual:** `operator_fabric_view.py:523` still reads audit history with a
  full parse; fold into future audit-rotation work if that surface needs history.
- **Compatibility track:** rm-011 (official MCP Tasks extension mapping) and rm-012
  (MRTR approval handshake) are research-backed by the MCP 2026-07-28 spec GA; both
  are additive and gated on the SDK pin lanes from rm-009 being green first.
- **Rebase note (assess F10):** the campaign checkout `/work/projects/hermes-gpt` sits
  one docs-only merge behind `origin/master`; rebase before the next implement phase.

## Cycle 4 — 2026-09-30 — "Serving-loop correctness + fail-loud operator signals"

Run `bb9c68fb3ddf4c9fa77ead75cac72f07` (repository-maintenance
`029a8a7e970d4317997a96e5dab638eb`, cycle 1) against worktree at `14530e3e79`.
Phases: assess → research → roadmap → prioritize → stewardship → implement →
targeted tests → full tests → compound. All outcomes below are pre-review: the
batch is implemented and locally verified but uncommitted, awaiting the fold and
commit gates. Two sibling runs of the same campaign (run-041a92f6667d,
run-e13b1c0d37ea) worked the same base in parallel; this cycle's batch was chosen
to be disjoint from both (serving/UI surface vs their threads/state and
error-contract batches).

### What the cycle did

- **rm-076 (P110)** — offloaded every blocking sqlite/`SessionDB._lock` call
  reachable from async handlers off the single serving loop: `ui_chat.py`
  sessions/messages/chat-post handlers (asyncio.to_thread, the in-file
  extraction-helper pattern) and `operator_live_events.py`'s WS poll
  `read_since` (connect timeout=5 + two queries, previously every ≤0.5s per
  idle client on the loop). A lock-contention regression test holds
  `SessionDB._lock` in a background thread while a concurrent request must
  complete inside a bound — it times out against the pre-fix code.
- **rm-080** — replaced the tautological cursor clamp
  `max(next, min(high, next))` with a real high-watermark advance; the MAX(seq)
  is now read BEFORE the page query so a concurrent insert is delivered or
  rescanned, never skipped.
- **rm-078** — a failed `ui_api` mount (explicitly-enabled UI) now emits an
  audit record + `ui_mount_failed` live event while the server still boots, and
  `hermes_operator_doctor` reports a `ui_mount` WARN from the audit tail.
- **rm-079** — `operator_events` now applies the source allowlist once at the
  boundary for BOTH `hermes_events_query` and `hermes_events_tail` (truthful
  `sources_queried`, warnings on both paths); `_collect` stays the enforcement
  point.

Verification (pre-review): targeted uv run of the 10 changed surfaces
144/144/0/0; the engine's full gate (`local_validation_gate.py --shell-command
'uv run python -m pytest -q -n 8'`) exit 0 with 0 failed/errored and 2
pre-existing environment skips; ruff clean. 14 tracked files changed,
+509/−23, including 11 new regression tests.

### Prevention rules established

1. **Async handlers own no blocking store.** Any sqlite/lock/timeout-bound call
   reachable from an async handler or WS loop runs via `asyncio.to_thread`
   (the in-file extraction-helper pattern is the reference). Symptom class: a
   shared lock with a 5s busy timeout plus sync TestClient tests that can
   never observe the stall. Enforce with a contention regression test (hold
   the lock in a thread, bound a concurrent request), not just green suites.
2. **Paginate against a pre-read watermark.** In snapshot-per-connection
   stores, read the high watermark BEFORE the page query: a late-arriving
   higher seq is then delivered or rescanned instead of skipped forever.
   Tautological clamps (`max(x, min(h, x))`) hide as dead queries — a clamp
   must change the value in at least one tested case or be deleted.
3. **Fail-loud extends to mounting, not just calls.** Cycle-1 rule 3 ("best
   effort must not mean invisible") applies to surface assembly: an
   explicitly-enabled surface that fails to attach must produce an audit
   record + live event + doctor check, never an eprint only.
4. **Validate new tests in the project lane, not the ambient interpreter.** A
   test importing `httpx` passed under the ambient Python but failed the uv
   gate (httpx is not a project dependency). Test helpers are dependency-free
   (raw ASGI calls) or uv-declared.
5. **Audit-reading tests must pin the audit override.**
   `set_audit_log_override` leaks across tests sharing an xdist worker
   (mission/swarm fixtures), while the events audit reader resolves
   `<hermes_root>/logs` independently — pin the override in try/finally or the
   test depends on worker scheduling. Follow-up candidate: an autouse reset
   fixture.
6. **Parallel campaign runs mint ids independently.** Three sibling runs each
   allocated `rm-076`+ on the same base; the landing gate must dedupe by scope
   and renumber before integration. Roadmap blocks carry run-ids and
   orig-id annotations so collisions are detectable in place.

### Local toolchain notes (small, reusable)

- The conductor validation gate self-throttles under system load (admitted
  workers=1 at load1=21.74) — a slow-but-green full gate is still a valid full
  pass; do not re-run for speed alone.
- Neither conductor validation script prints a digest; the digest is a
  manifest hash. Identical digests across two dispatches proves the tree
  unchanged between them — useful as a zero-cost identity check.
- The impacted-tests runner (`run_repo_impacted_tests.py --mode fast`) is the
  correct focused lane and honors the uv venv; ambient `python -m pytest` is
  not equivalent (rule 4).

### Context left for the next cycle

- **Upstream adoption is the headliner (rm-081, P115):** upstream/master is 8
  commits past merge-base `7795aa3ce8`, including the issue-#74 full half
  (explicit-load resolution, fail-closed loader errors, `preprocess=False`
  probes; `operator_skill_resolution.py` delta 546+/285−). PR #76 closed
  unmerged — master is the sole carrier. Both sibling runs minted equivalent
  items; none selected it (L effort, 3-way reconciliation). rm-054/rm-036
  fold into it; rm-053 closes with it.
- **rm-079 residual:** the same allowlist-indirection pattern exists at
  `operator_mission_ledger.py:623` and `operator_capability_manifest.py:483`.
- **Packaging pair:** rm-077 (browser-UI build path, collides with sibling
  041a92f6's pyproject/MANIFEST work — coordinate at the landing gate) and
  rm-083 (v0.13.0 release-readiness; deployed remote is 47 commits behind;
  blocked on rm-065/rm-069 policy).
- **Landing-gate duties:** renumber the three sibling `rm-076`+ sets; reconcile
  the pre-existing duplicate id lines recorded in the cycle-4 ROADMAP header;
  apply the server.py cross-run separation hint when integrating the sibling
  ToolError hunks.
- **Candidate hardening:** autouse fixture resetting `set_audit_log_override`;
  additive py3.13 CI lane (ci edits were prohibited in-cycle); the two
  environment-dependent skips in the full suite remain unowned.

## Cycle 5 — 2026-10-01 — "Turn-lease renewal + bounded graceful shutdown"

Run `b665941020024956b7fca47ce2b28813` (repository-maintenance `d9d185eb`) against
the worktree at `caf60018d2`. Selected batch from the cycle-5 roadmap block in the
root [`../ROADMAP.md`](../ROADMAP.md): rm-102 + rm-105 + rm-113, rider rm-115.

### What the cycle did

- **rm-102 (HIGH, reliability):** chat turns acquired the session turn lease with
  a 300 s TTL but never renewed it, so any turn longer than the TTL silently lost
  the one-live-turn invariant (`ui_chat.py`; `hermes_state.refresh_session_turn_lease`
  was dead code with zero callers). The turn worker now renews at one-fifth of the
  TTL, and a lease that can no longer be renewed aborts the turn on the existing
  cancellation path instead of expiring underneath it.
- **rm-105 (MEDIUM, reliability):** neither `uvicorn.run` site set
  `timeout_graceful_shutdown` and no lifespan drained live SSE/WS streams, so
  SIGTERM could hang until killed and kill the process with the turn lease still
  held. Both run sites are bounded (10 s), and the composed ASGI lifespan drains
  registered chat SSE and operator live-event WS streams (5 s) via the new
  `live_streams` registry before the MCP lifespan closes.
- **rm-113 (MEDIUM, docs truth):** `docs/README.md` labeled the v0.8.0 and v0.6.0
  release-note rows "current release record" against repository version 0.12.0,
  and the v0.10/v0.11/v0.12 note files had no authority-map rows at all. The two
  stale labels were corrected and the three missing rows added.
- **rm-115 (rider, tooling):** `tools/upstream_gap.py` — a read-only probe of the
  upstream gap (commits, tags, open PRs) so cycle planning does not re-derive it
  by hand; see the usage pointer in Local toolchain notes below.

### Prevention rules established

- A TTL'd lease with no renewal path is a defect, not an optimization: new lease
  acquire sites ship with their renewal + loss semantics and a regression test.
- Every `uvicorn.run` site sets `timeout_graceful_shutdown`; long-lived streaming
  handlers register with `live_streams` so shutdown can cancel them promptly.

### Local toolchain notes (small, reusable)

- `python tools/upstream_gap.py [--repo-root PATH] [--remote NAME] [--json]` answers
  the cycle-planning probes in one read-only call: behind/ahead counts against
  `<remote>/master`, fast-forward-vs-merge, newest local vs remote tag (an absent
  `v0.13.0` is the rm-103 gate), and open upstream PRs via `gh` (best effort —
  offline fields degrade to `null`/unknown and the probe still exits 0). It never
  fetches or mutates refs; the rm-103 re-probe trigger is one command, not a
  re-derivation.

### Validation record (2026-10-03, pre-review)

Recorded outcomes consumed by the compound phase (not re-run there):

- **Targeted gate** (impacted surface): RC=0, ~184 s — envelope
  `/home/agent/.hermes/local-validation-gate/results/result-1745518-350446670.json`;
  `ruff check .` clean at the pinned dev version.
- **Full gate** (`python -m pytest -q`): RC=0 — 1627 tests, 5 environment skips,
  0 failures, ~251 s — envelope
  `/home/agent/.hermes/local-validation-gate/results/result-745880-351751581.json`.
- Validation digest
  `validation:v1:eb9c95f0599d39351c98c2523b7ecd982b88c1cf41fa98e6ea1e712ba3d94c52`
  current at `caf60018d2` with the uncommitted cycle delta.

Durable artifacts added by the compound phase: runbook
[`solutions/session-turn-lease-expires-mid-turn.md`](solutions/session-turn-lease-expires-mid-turn.md)
(the rm-102 lesson, red/green included) and the root `CONCEPTS.md` glossary
seed for the session-turn-lease vocabulary. Review and shipping outcomes are
carried forward by the next cycle's assessment, per the compound work order.

### Context left for the next cycle

- Deferred cycle-5 candidates stay in the roadmap block: rm-103 is gated on
  the v0.13.0 tag — upstream still advertises v0.12.0 as newest, and that
  tag's commit is not contained in this fork's HEAD, so `python
  tools/upstream_gap.py` reports it unadopted — plus open PRs (live re-probe
  2026-10-03T13:47Z: only #85 open; #84 merged 2026-10-03T03:27Z, #83 merged
  04:02Z); rm-106, rm-111, and rm-114 are contested
  by sibling-run implementations and fold at the landing gate; rm-104/rm-112 were
  implemented by run `0aa75ea44f93`.
